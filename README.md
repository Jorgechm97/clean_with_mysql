##Nashville Housing Project

In this project, I worked on cleaning and preparing data for a Nashville real estate database. Below are some of the tasks I performed:

- Split addresses into individual columns (address, city, state).
- Update the date format in the table.
- Normalize the 'Y' and 'N' values â€‹â€‹in the 'SoldAsVacant' field to 'Yes' and 'No'.
- Remove duplicates and unwanted columns in the table.
